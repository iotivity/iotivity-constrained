      "message": "This is a simple helper method to also clean-up the link instead of only removing it. We usually simply allocate resource using oc_new_resource and add it to a link. We do not store it additionally. I wanted to document later in the API that this function releases also the resource unless the delete handler is set and that this must be set, if not oc_new_resource was used to allocate it. This way we do not need to have our own list of allocated resources.",
