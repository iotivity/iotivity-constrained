Getting Started
---------------
IoTivity-Constrained is an open-source software stack and library that
implements the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) standards for the
Internet of Things (IoT).

It was designed specifically to build IoT applications for resource-constrained
hardware and software environments. It targets the wide range of
embedded devices using low-power and low-cost MCUs that will proliferate the
IoT landscape.

It addresses the following design goals:

1) Laying down constraints: This is achieved through build-time
configuration of a set of parameters that constrain the number of serviceable
connections and requests, payload sizes, memory pool sizes, timeouts etc.
These collectively characterize an acceptable workload for an
application.

2) Determinism: All memory is statically allocated, and requests fail
gracefully whenever a workload exceeds the set constraints.

3) OCF-compliant common core: IoTivity-Constrained will be employed on diverse
hardware-software environments, while the OCF standards independently evolve.
The framework architecture is therefore decoupled into a platform-agnostic
common core which will be maintained for OCF compliance with a set of
interfaces into implementations of platform-specific code. This decoupling
isolates all of the OCF and application layer functionality from the
platform/environment specific code that varies per deployment.
In this way, a vendor may based on their requirements choose to deploy
IoTivity-Constrained with their choice of hardware and software environment
while utilizing the common core.

4) Platform abstraction interfaces: These are a collection of headers with a
key set of hooks that elicit a contract from implementations. The core
framework talks via these interfaces to interact with platform specific
functionality. Implementations may be built with any choice of embedded RTOS,
network stack and hardware. Any such implementation then becomes a “port”.
Ports currently exist for Linux and Zephyr.

5) Being lightweight: The is achieved through tight coupling between stack
layers and avoiding modularity unless warranted.

Project directory structure
---------------------------
The IoTivity-Constrained source tree has the following directory structure:

api/* contains the implementations of client/server APIs, the resource model
and introspection layer, utility and helper functions to encode/decode to/from
OCF’s data model, module for encoding and interpreting type 4 UUIDs, and
handlers for the discovery, platform and device resources.

messaging/coap/* contains an OCF-tailored CoAP implementation.

security/* contains the handlers for secure core OCF resources.

utils/* contains a few primitive building blocks used internally by the core
framework.

deps/* contains external project dependencies.
deps/tinycbor/* contains the tinyCBOR project.
deps/tinydtls/* contains the tinyDTLS project.

include/* contains common (across modules) headers.
include/oc_api.h contains client/server APIs.
include/oc_rep.h contains helper functions to encode/decode to/from OCF’s
data model.
include/oc_helpers.h contains utility functions for allocating strings and
arrays from the internal memory pools.
port/*.h represents the platform abstraction interfaces.
port/linux/* contains an implementation of a Linux port.
port/zephyr/* contains an implementation of a Zephyr port.

apps/* contains sample OCF applications.

Pull Dependencies
-----------------
Run “git submodule update --init” from <iotivity-constrained-root>/.

Building sample applications on Linux
-------------------------------------
The entire build is specified in port/linux/Makefile. The output of the build
consists of all sample application binaries that are stored under port/linux.

Run “make” for a release mode build without debug output and security.
Run “make DEBUG=1” for debug mode build with debug output and without security.
Add “..SECURE=1” to the command-lines above for a complete build including
tinyDTLS and modules that implement secure mode operation.

Building sample applications on Zephyr (with qemu)
--------------------------------------------------
First set up your Zephyr development environment following the “Getting Started
Guide” on
https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html.

Before running “make”, update port/zephyr/src/Makefile to include your choice
of Zephyr sample from apps/.

Run “source <Zephyr root>/zephyr-env.sh”.
Run “make pristine && make” from port/zephyr.
This should result in a complete build of the Zephyr kernel
and subsystems, the IoTivity-Constrained framework, and the sample app.

Clone the net-tools repository from gerrit.zephyrproject.org.
Follow its README to set up a tun interface using the tunslip6 tool.
This exposes a network interface on Linux to communicate with Zephyr’s
IP stack and the sample app.

Run “make qemu” from port/zephyr. This runs the chosen sample on Zephyr
in qemu.

Now run any appropriate Linux client/server sample against the Zephyr sample
to view the request/response flow.

Framework configuration
-----------------------
Build-time configuration options for an application are to be set in the file
named config.h. This needs to be present in one of the include paths.
Pre-populated configurations for the Linux/Zephyr samples are present in
port/linux/config.h and port/zephyr/config.h.
