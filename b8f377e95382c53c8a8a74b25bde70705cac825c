      "message": "This particular fix is correct. \nBut I just noticed another issue here, which has always been there, that even if we have supply response payload, we should also be sending the resource handle (and not NULL) in the call to coap_notify_observers() since if we match only by endpoint, that same endpoint could\u0027ve subscribed to multiple resources. This issue (and this logic) is only present when we\u0027re sending notifications from a \"slow\" resource via the separate response mechanism, and not otherwise. I\u0027ll post a fix for it.",

      "message": "\u003e My understanding returning 10, 20, or 30 is not helpful. I think 3 is a \n\u003e reasonable value: the number of notifications we sent. \n\nNo, the value that is actually useful over here is if the resource has 0 observers. It is used on the server side only to tear down any pending periodic callbacks to coap_notify_observers(). Any value \u003e\u003d1 when there are observers is fine to return. So, your change is probably fine. The code was previously just returning num_observers for that resource instead which would produce the same result.\n\n\u003e What prompted me to do this was the case where we pass \n\u003e resource\u003d\u003dNULL and endpoint!\u003dNULL.\n\nYes, this is precisely the issue I spoke about in my other comment. This needs to be fixed and I will post a fix for it. Even when we have the payload and endpoint (which is the case for a separate response), we need to know which resource it is sending from. Once fixed, we will never have a case of resource \u003d\u003d NULL and endpoint !\u003d NULL.",

If \"resource !\u003d NULL\" is invalid, then my example above can be ignored, as there\u0027s always only one resource involved. ;-)\n\nI still suggest you define the return value as the number of separated notifications that were sent, which will be \"num_observers\" when endpoint \u003d\u003d NULL, or some value between 0 and \"num_observers\" when endpoint !\u003d NULL. Or, if you don\u0027t care about the counting, just return whether notifications were sent or not.",
