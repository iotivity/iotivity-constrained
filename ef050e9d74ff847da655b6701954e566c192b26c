      "message": "Well, the modulo is completely superfluous. It won\u0027t add absolutely any value to your code and will always be optimised out of existence. It\u0027s actually better to have a plain assignment than to do this modulo.\n\nThe cast, however, may solve a cast warning (not default in GCC): when casting from an unsigned int to uint16_t, the compiler could complain.",
