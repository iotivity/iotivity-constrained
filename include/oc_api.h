  Optional group of functions to support OCF compliant scenes.

  The layout of scenes is this:
  - Scene List:
    - structure: oc_collection_t (is an \c oc_resource_t)
    - rt: oic.wk.scenelist
    - URI: /OCSceneListURI (see \c OC_SCENELIST_URI)
    - not discoverable by default
    - is simply in the list of collections in \c oc_collection.h
  - Scene Collection:
    - structure: oc_collection_t (is an \c oc_resource_t)
    - rt: oic.wk.scenecollection
    - URI: (specified by app)
    - not discoverable by default
    - is linked as resource in oc_link_t in the scene list
  - Scene Member
    - structure: oc_scene_member_t (is an \c oc_resource_t)
    - rt: oic.wk.scenemember
    - URI: (specified by app)
    - not discoverable by default
    - is linked as resource in oc_link_t in a scene collection
  - Scene Mapping
    - structure: oc_scene_mapping_t (is NOT an \c oc_resource_t)
    - rt: (none)
    - URI (none)
    - discoverability is based on the setting of the parent scene member
    - is simply in the list of mappings in a scene member

  @warning Use the according scene functions where available instead
   of the corresponding collection functions. Otherwise the internal
   lists may become corrupted.

  Comparison to OCF 1.0 and IoTivity:
  - Scene list, collection and member have interfaces oic.if.a, oic.if.ll
    and oic.if.baseline as specified in OCF 1.0. IoTivitiy uses oic.if.b
    instead of oic.if.a.
  - Property sceneValues is a string array instead of a string just like
    in IoTivity. OCF 1.0 specifies here a string, but there is already a
    change request to change this to a string array.
  - There is currently no support to setup scene collections, members and
    mappings remotely. Only the local app can create and modify these.
    Only the property lastScene can also be set remotely.

  @note In case of multiple devices: As of now there is at most one
   scene list and this is assigned to device 0.
  @note When a new scene is triggered, then the stack does not update the
  resource properties by itself yet. This needs to be done by the app.

  To have the app receive the notifications when the value of lastScene
  changes, register a post handler with each scene collection:
  \code oc_resource_set_request_handler(
  <scene collection>, OC_POST, <post callback>, NULL);\endcode
  The post callback will be called after the lastScene value has been updated.
  The handler shall NOT send any response. The according scene collection is
  set as request resource.
