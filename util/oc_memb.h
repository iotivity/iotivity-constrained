/**
 * \defgroup memb Memory block management functions
 *
 * The memory block allocation routines provide a simple yet powerful
 * set of functions for managing a set of memory blocks of fixed
 * size. A set of memory blocks is statically declared with the
 * OC_MEMB() macro. Memory blocks are allocated from the declared
 * memory by the oc_memb_alloc() function, and are deallocated with the
 * oc_memb_free() function.
